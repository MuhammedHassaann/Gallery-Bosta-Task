# My Gallery

"My Gallery" is a minimalist Android app that dynamically fetches a random user's details and albums using Retrofit. The home screen presents the user's information, while selecting an album navigates to a secondary screen displaying all images with a search bar for easy filtering by title. Tapping on an image leads to a dedicated preview screen equipped with zoom functionality. The app also supports seamless sharing of images with other applications, enhancing user interaction and engagement.
